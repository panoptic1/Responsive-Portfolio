      <p>Hello, World! I am a full-stack developer based in the Twin Cities. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and a number of other languages.</p>

      <p>Prior to beginning my journey into the world of web development, I had made a career for myself as a teacher on the secondary level. I spent the vast majority of my time trying to find ways to convey content to large groups in the most effective possible way, as well as managing and sorting the large amounts of data that were being produced by the same group on a constant basis. These pursuits led me to code.</p>

      <p>Having been a lover of language for as long as I can remember, I also write essays, poems, and prose. At some point, I would like to create an online database which would enable aspiring writers to critique one another's work.</p>
